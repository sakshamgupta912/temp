## ‚úÖ Quick Test (5 minutes)

### Test 1: Update a Category Description

1. **Open the app**
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Category Management**
3. **Edit "Food & Dining" category** (or similar):
   ```
   Name: Food & Dining
   Description: Restaurants, food delivery services including Swiggy, 
                Zomato, Uber Eats, groceries, snacks, and beverages
   ```

5. **Go to AI Transactions tab**
6. **Add a test transaction**:
   - Amount: `350`
   - Description: `Swiggy lunch order`
7. **Tap "Add Transaction"**

8. **Check the prediction**:
   - Should suggest "Food & Dining" category
   - Confidence should be **70-85%** (HIGH!)
   - Reason should mention: "Transaction matches category purpose..."

### Test 2: New Category with Description

1. **Create a NEW category**:
   ```
   Name: Entertainment
   Description: Movies, streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, 
                Spotify, gaming, concerts, and recreational activities
   ```

2. **Add a transaction** (without any prior history):
   - Amount: `199`
   - Description: `Netflix monthly subscription`

3. **Check the prediction**:
   - Should suggest "Entertainment" ‚úÖ
   - Should have **75-90% confidence** (even on FIRST use!)
   - This proves semantic matching works immediately!

### Test 3: Book Description Matching

1. **Edit a book** (e.g., "Personal"):
   ```
   Name: Personal
   Description: Daily personal expenses including food, entertainment, 
                shopping, personal care, hobbies, and leisure
   ```

2. **Add transaction**:
   - Amount: `1299`

## üé® Best Practices

### ‚úÖ Good Description Examples

**Category: Food & Dining**
```
Description: All food expenses including restaurants, cafes, 
             food delivery (Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats), groceries,
             snacks, and beverages
```
‚úÖ Includes specific merchant names
‚úÖ Lists related concepts
‚úÖ Comprehensive coverage

**Category: Transport**
```
Description: Uber, Ola, auto rickshaw, metro, bus tickets, fuel,
             parking, and vehicle maintenance
```
‚úÖ Mentions common services
‚úÖ Includes various transport types

**Book: Business Expenses**
```
Description: Work-related costs including office supplies, client meetings,
             business travel, software subscriptions like Office365, Zoom,
             and professional services
```
‚úÖ Explains book purpose
‚úÖ Lists typical transaction types
‚úÖ Names specific tools

### ‚ùå Avoid

**Bad Example 1:**
```
Description: "For food"
```
‚ùå Too vague, no keywords

**Bad Example 2:**
```
Description: ""
```
‚ùå Empty description, AI falls back to keyword matching only

**Bad Example 3:**
```
Description: "Miscellaneous expenses"
```
‚ùå Generic, doesn't help AI distinguish

## üîç How to Debug

### If Confidence is Still Low:

1. **Check your descriptions**:
   - Are they detailed enough?
   - Do they include relevant keywords?
   - Do they mention common merchants?

2. **Check transaction description**:
   - Is it clear? ("Swiggy" vs "online food")
   - Does it have keywords that match your category descriptions?

3. **Check console logs** (if debugging):
   ```
   Look for: "Semantic similarity:" or "Transaction matches category purpose"
   ```

### If Wrong Category is Chosen:

1. **Update category description** to include relevant keywords
2. **Test again** - should improve immediately
3. **Or use Edit button** to correct, AI will learn

## üìû Questions?

- **Q: Do I need to delete old learning data?**
  A: No! Semantic matching works alongside learning. Both contribute to predictions.

- **Q: What if I don't add descriptions?**
  A: AI falls back to old method (learning + keywords). Still works, just lower initial confidence.

- **Q: Can I mix languages in descriptions?**
  A: Yes! "Sabzi, kirana, BigBasket, groceries" - all work!

- **Q: How often should I update descriptions?**
  A: Whenever you notice misclassifications or add new spending patterns.
