# üéØ Quick Fix Reference - Sync Overwrites

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

### The Problem:
- ‚ùå Deletions overwritten by edits from other devices
- ‚ùå Updates overwritten when conflicts exist  
- ‚ùå Conflict resolution not working

### The Fix (in `gitStyleSync.ts`):

1. **Version tracking fixed** ‚Üí `lastSyncedVersion` now updates on ALL merge paths
2. **Change detection fixed** ‚Üí `localVersion > lastSyncedVersion` detects changes correctly
3. **Version increment fixed** ‚Üí ALWAYS increments after merge: `max(local, cloud) + 1`
4. **Deletion handling fixed** ‚Üí Version increments on delete operations
5. **Field comparison fixed** ‚Üí Removed broken base tracking, uses direct comparison

## üß™ Quick Test (5 minutes)

### Test 1: Simple Update ‚úÖ
```
1. Device A: Create entry "Test" ‚Çπ100
2. Device A: Pull to refresh (syncs)
3. Device B: Pull to refresh (downloads)
4. Device A: Edit to ‚Çπ200
5. Device A: Pull to refresh
6. Device B: Pull to refresh
7. ‚úÖ Device B should show ‚Çπ200
```

### Test 2: Delete vs Edit ‚ö†Ô∏è (Conflict Expected)
```
1. Create entry on both devices (synced)
2. Turn OFF WiFi on both
3. Device A: Delete entry
4. Device B: Edit entry
5. Turn ON WiFi on Device A, sync
6. Turn ON WiFi on Device B, sync
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Should see "DELETE-EDIT CONFLICT" in console
8. ‚úÖ Entry should be deleted on both
```

### Test 3: Concurrent Edits ‚ö†Ô∏è (Conflict Expected)
```
1. Create entry on both devices (synced)
2. Turn OFF WiFi on both
3. Device A: Edit amount to ‚Çπ500
4. Device B: Edit amount to ‚Çπ600
5. Turn ON WiFi on Device A, sync
6. Turn ON WiFi on Device B, sync
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è Should see "CONFLICT on amount" in console
8. ‚úÖ Device B shows ‚Çπ500 (cloud won)
```

## üìä Console Logs to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good (No Conflict):
```
üîÄ Three-way merge for entry abc123:
   Base: 1, Local: v1 (base: 1), Cloud: v2 (base: 1)
   ‚¨áÔ∏è Only cloud changed - fast-forward to cloud
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected Conflict:
```
üîÄ Three-way merge for entry def456:
   Base: 1, Local: v2 (base: 1), Cloud: v2 (base: 1)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Both sides changed - checking fields for conflicts...
   ‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT on "amount": local="600" vs cloud="500"
   ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 conflicts detected - using cloud values by default
```

### üóëÔ∏è Deletion (No Conflict):
```
üîÄ Three-way merge for entry ghi789:
   Base: 1, Local: v2 (base: 1), Cloud: v1 (base: 1)
   üóëÔ∏è Local deleted, cloud unchanged - using deletion
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete-Edit Conflict:
```
üîÄ Three-way merge for entry jkl012:
   Base: 1, Local: v2 (base: 1), Cloud: v2 (base: 1)
   ‚ö†Ô∏è DELETE-EDIT CONFLICT: Local deleted, cloud edited
```

## üîç How to Debug

### Check Version Numbers:
Open React Native Debugger console and run:
```javascript
console.log('Books:', books.map(b => ({ 
  id: b.id.substring(0, 8), 
  name: b.name, 
  version: b.version, 
  lastSyncedVersion: b.lastSyncedVersion,
  deleted: b.deleted
})));
```

### Check Firestore Data:
1. Open Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore
2. Navigate to: `users/{userId}/books`
3. Verify `version` and `lastSyncedVersion` fields exist
4. Check that `version` increments on edits

### Force Conflict for Testing:
```
1. Turn OFF WiFi on BOTH devices
2. Edit same entry on both (same field, different values)
3. Turn ON WiFi on Device A first
4. Pull to refresh on Device A (uploads first)
5. Turn ON WiFi on Device B
6. Pull to refresh on Device B (should detect conflict)
```

## üìã Version Number Expectations

| Operation | Before | After | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|-------|
| Create | - | v1, lastSynced: undefined | New item |
| First Sync | v1, lastSynced: undefined | v1, lastSynced: 1 | Synced to cloud |
| Edit Local | v1, lastSynced: 1 | v2, lastSynced: 1 | Not synced yet |
| Sync Edit | v2, lastSynced: 1 | v2, lastSynced: 2 | Synced |
| Other Device Downloads | v1, lastSynced: 1 | v2, lastSynced: 2 | Fast-forward |
| Both Edit | v2/v2, lastSynced: 1 | v3, lastSynced: 2 | Merged with conflict |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

1. **Cloud wins by default** - No UI to choose local vs cloud yet
2. **No field-level base tracking** - Can't detect "both changed to same value"
3. **Conflict UI missing** - Conflicts only logged to console
4. **Manual resolution not implemented** - User can't pick which value to keep

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After testing, you should see:

- ‚úÖ Simple updates sync correctly (no overwrites)
- ‚úÖ Deletions propagate properly (not overwritten)
- ‚úÖ Version numbers increment correctly
- ‚úÖ lastSyncedVersion updates after sync
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Conflicts detected when both edit same field
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Delete-Edit conflicts detected
- ‚úÖ No sync loops (re-syncing same data)

---

## üöÄ Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Conflict UI** - Show conflicts to user with resolution options
2. **Improve Base Tracking** - Track base values per field for better conflict detection
3. **Add Sync Status** - Show "Syncing...", "‚úÖ Synced", "‚ö†Ô∏è Conflicts" indicators
4. **Offline Queue** - Queue operations when offline, auto-sync when online

---

## üÜò If Still Having Issues

1. Check `asyncStorage.ts` - Verify version increments on update
2. Check `AuthContext.tsx` - Verify sync flow: Pull ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Save ‚Üí Push
3. Check Firestore security rules - Verify user can read/write their data
4. Check console logs - Look for merge decision logs
5. Check version numbers - Use debugger to inspect values

**Status**: ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Core merge logic bugs resolved. Ready for testing!
