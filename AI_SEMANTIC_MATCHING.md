# üß† Semantic Classification System - AI Description Alignment

## Overview

The AI now uses **semantic matching** to align transaction predictions with your predefined book and category **descriptions**. This ensures that as you update or create new books/categories with clear descriptions, the AI automatically adapts to classify transactions correctly.

---

## üéØ Why Semantic Matching Matters

### Before (Keyword-only approach):
```typescript
Transaction: "Amazon Prime Video subscription"
Keywords: ["amazon", "prime", "video", "subscription"]
Result: Matches "Shopping" (because of "Amazon")
‚ùå Problem: Might not align with your "Entertainment" category
```

### After (Description-based approach):
```typescript
Transaction: "Amazon Prime Video subscription"
Category: "Entertainment"
Description: "Movies, streaming services, Netflix, Prime Video, etc."

AI: "Hey, 'Prime Video' is mentioned in Entertainment description!"
Result: Matches "Entertainment" category ‚úÖ
Confidence: 85% (high)
```

## üìö How Book Classification Works Now

### Scoring System (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. **Semantic Match - Book Description** (30 points)
- Compares transaction text with book description
- Uses keyword overlap and contextual matching
- Example:
  ```typescript
  Book: "Business Expenses"
  Description: "Office supplies, client meetings, travel, software subscriptions"
  
  Transaction: "Office365 subscription"
  Match: "office" + "subscription" found in description
  Score: 25/30 points ‚Üí High alignment!
  ```

#### 2. **Merchant Pattern (from learning)** (30 points)
- Historical data about merchant preferences
- Example: "Swiggy" always goes to "Personal" book

#### 3. **Amount Patterns** (20 points)
- Recognizes amount ranges associated with each book
- Example: ‚Çπ15,000 transactions usually go to "Shared" (rent)

#### 4. **Recent Activity** (15 points)
- Books used frequently get slight priority
- Prevents cold-start issues

#### 5. **Currency Match** (5 points)
- Matches transaction currency with book currency

---

## üè∑Ô∏è How Category Classification Works Now

### Scoring System (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. **Semantic Match - Category Description** (70 points)
This is now the PRIMARY classification method!

```typescript
Category: "Food & Dining"
Description: "Restaurants, food delivery (Swiggy, Zomato), groceries, cafes"

Transaction: "Zomato dinner order"
Keywords in transaction: ["zomato", "dinner", "order"]
Keywords in description: ["restaurants", "food", "delivery", "swiggy", "zomato", "groceries", "cafes"]

Match Analysis:
- "zomato" ‚Üí Exact match in description ‚úÖ
- "dinner" ‚Üí Related to "restaurants" ‚úÖ
- Coverage: 2/3 keywords matched
- Score: 65/70 points

Final: 65% confidence ‚Üí "Food & Dining" ‚úÖ
```

#### 2. **Category Name Match** (30 points)
- Fallback if no description provided
- Example: "transport" in transaction ‚Üí "Transport" category

#### 3. **Merchant Mappings** (Priority boost to 90%)
- If merchant is recognized from past transactions
- Overrides semantic matching for consistency

#### 4. **Learning Data** (Priority boost to 85%)
- Patterns from user corrections
- Gets stronger over time

## üí° How to Leverage This Feature

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

#### 1. **Write Descriptive Book Descriptions**

**Good Examples:**
```typescript
Book: "Personal Expenses"
Description: "Daily personal spending - food, entertainment, shopping, 
             personal care, hobbies, and leisure activities"

Book: "Business Expenses"
Description: "Work-related costs including office supplies, client meetings,
             business travel, software subscriptions, and professional services"

Book: "Shared Household"
Description: "Shared apartment costs - rent, utilities, internet, groceries,
             cleaning supplies, and home maintenance"
```

**Why This Works:**
- AI can match "Netflix subscription" ‚Üí "entertainment" ‚Üí Personal
- AI can match "Office365" ‚Üí "software subscriptions" ‚Üí Business
- AI can match "Rent payment" ‚Üí "rent" ‚Üí Shared Household

#### 2. **Write Comprehensive Category Descriptions**

**Good Examples:**
```typescript
Category: "Food & Dining"
Description: "All food-related expenses including restaurants, cafes, 
             food delivery services (Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats), groceries,
             snacks, and beverages"

Category: "Transport"
Description: "Transportation costs including Uber, Ola, auto rickshaw,
             metro, bus tickets, fuel, parking, and vehicle maintenance"

Category: "Entertainment"
Description: "Leisure and entertainment including movies, Netflix, Prime Video,
             Spotify, concerts, events, gaming, and recreational activities"

Category: "Bills & Utilities"
Description: "Regular bills including electricity, water, gas, internet,
             mobile recharge, DTH, and other utility services"

Category: "Health & Medical"
Description: "Healthcare expenses including doctor visits, medicines,
             pharmacy, lab tests, health insurance, and wellness"
```

**Why This Works:**
- Mentions specific merchant names (Swiggy, Zomato, Uber, Netflix)
- Includes related terms (delivery, streaming, recharge)
- Covers broad context (food, transport, entertainment)

#### 3. **Include Common Merchant Names**

```typescript
// Instead of just:
Description: "Shopping expenses"

// Write:
Description: "Online and offline shopping including Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra,
             clothing, electronics, books, and general retail"
```

The AI will recognize "Amazon" in transactions and match it!

#### 4. **Use Synonyms and Related Terms**

```typescript
Category: "Education"
Description: "Learning and education including courses, books, Udemy, Coursera,
             tutoring, training programs, workshops, and educational materials"
```

Covers: "course", "book", specific platforms, and related concepts.

## üîç Technical Deep Dive

### Semantic Similarity Algorithm

#### Step 1: Keyword Extraction
```typescript
Transaction: "Swiggy dinner order for family"
Extracted Keywords: ["swiggy", "dinner", "order", "family"]

Category Description: "Food delivery services like Swiggy, Zomato, restaurants"
Extracted Keywords: ["food", "delivery", "services", "swiggy", "zomato", "restaurants"]
```

#### Step 2: Matching
```typescript
Exact Matches:
- "swiggy" === "swiggy" ‚Üí 1.0 point

Partial Matches:
- "dinner" related to "food" ‚Üí 0.7 points (contextual)
- "order" related to "services" ‚Üí 0.7 points (contextual)

Total Match Score: 2.4
```

#### Step 3: Coverage Calculation
```typescript
Transaction Coverage: 2.4 / 4 keywords = 60%
Description Coverage: 2.4 / 6 keywords = 40%

Harmonic Mean: (2 * 0.60 * 0.40) / (0.60 + 0.40) = 48%

Match Boost: 2 keywords matched √ó 5% = 10%

Final Similarity: 48% + 10% = 58%
```

#### Step 4: Confidence Scoring
```typescript
Semantic Score: 58% √ó 70 points = 40.6 points
Name Match: 20% √ó 30 points = 6 points

Total: 46.6 points ‚Üí 46% confidence
Result: Medium confidence match ‚úÖ
```

### Stop Words Filtering

Common words that are ignored:
```typescript
'the', 'and', 'or', 'to', 'for', 'with', 'payment', 'transaction', 
'order', 'paid', 'via', 'using', numbers, etc.
```

Why? These don't carry semantic meaning for classification.

## üìä Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Entertainment Classification

```typescript
// Your category setup:
Category: "Entertainment"
Description: "Movies, streaming services, Netflix, Prime Video, Spotify, 
             gaming, concerts, and recreational activities"

// Transaction:
Input: ‚Çπ199, "Netflix monthly subscription"

// AI Analysis:
Keywords: ["netflix", "monthly", "subscription"]
Description Keywords: ["movies", "streaming", "services", "netflix", "prime", 
                       "video", "spotify", "gaming", "concerts", "recreational"]

Match: "netflix" ‚Üí EXACT MATCH in description!
Similarity: 85%
Score: 85% √ó 70 = 59.5 points

// Result:
Prediction: "Entertainment" category
Confidence: 89% (HIGH) üü¢
Reason: "Transaction matches category purpose: 'Movies, streaming services...'"
```

### Example 2: Business vs Personal

```typescript
// Your books:
Book 1: "Personal"
Description: "Daily personal expenses, food, entertainment, shopping"

Book 2: "Business"
Description: "Work expenses, client meetings, office supplies, professional tools"

// Transaction:
Input: ‚Çπ999, "Microsoft Office 365 Business subscription"

// AI Analysis for "Personal":
Keywords: ["microsoft", "office", "business", "subscription"]
Match with "food, entertainment, shopping": 0% (no overlap)
Score: 0 points

// AI Analysis for "Business":
Keywords: ["microsoft", "office", "business", "subscription"]
Match with "office supplies, professional tools": 
- "office" ‚Üí MATCH
- "business" ‚Üí MATCH
- "subscription" ‚Üí related to "tools"
Similarity: 75%
Score: 75% √ó 30 = 22.5 points

// Result:
Prediction: "Business" book
Confidence: 73% (MEDIUM) üü°
Reason: "Transaction aligns with book purpose: 'Work expenses, office supplies...'"
```

### Example 3: Ambiguous Transaction

```typescript
Category: "Bills & Utilities"
Description: "Electricity, water, internet, mobile recharge, gas bills"

Transaction: ‚Çπ599, "Jio Fiber monthly payment"

// AI Analysis:
Keywords: ["jio", "fiber", "monthly", "payment"]
Description Keywords: ["electricity", "water", "internet", "mobile", "recharge", "gas", "bills"]

Match: "fiber" ‚Üí related to "internet" (contextual match)
Similarity: 45%
Score: 45% √ó 70 = 31.5 points

// Result:
Prediction: "Bills & Utilities"
Confidence: 62% (MEDIUM) üü°
Reason: "Transaction matches category purpose: 'Electricity, water, internet...'"

// User can approve or edit, AI learns from choice!
```

## üéì Advanced Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Handling Multiple Languages

If you write descriptions in mixed English + your language:

```typescript
Category: "Groceries"
Description: "Sabzi, kirana, supermarket, BigBasket, Blinkit, vegetables, 
             milk, daily essentials"

Transaction: "BigBasket weekly order"

AI: Matches "bigbasket" in description ‚Üí High confidence ‚úÖ
```

### Use Case 2: Evolving Categories

When you add a new category:

```typescript
// New category:
Category: "Pet Care" (NEWLY CREATED)
Description: "Pet food, veterinary, grooming, pet supplies, toys"

// Very next transaction:
Transaction: "Dog food from Pet Store"

AI: Matches "pet" keyword in description ‚Üí 70% confidence üü°
Result: Correctly classifies even on FIRST transaction!
```

No need for learning phase - semantic matching works immediately!

### Use Case 3: Broad vs Specific

```typescript
// If you prefer broad categories:
Category: "Shopping"
Description: "All shopping expenses including online, offline, clothing, 
             electronics, home goods, general retail"

// If you prefer specific categories:
Category: "Electronics"
Description: "Gadgets, laptops, phones, accessories, tech products"

Category: "Clothing"  
Description: "Apparel, fashion, clothing, shoes, accessories"

// AI adapts to YOUR categorization style!
Transaction: "Laptop from Croma"
‚Üí Goes to "Electronics" if specific
‚Üí Goes to "Shopping" if broad
```

## üîß Tuning the System

### If Predictions Are Too Broad

**Problem**: Everything goes to generic categories

**Solution**: Add more specific keywords to descriptions

```typescript
// Before:
Category: "Shopping"
Description: "Shopping"

// After:
Category: "Shopping"
Description: "Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, retail stores, malls, clothing, 
             electronics, books, home decor, general purchases"
```

### If Predictions Are Too Specific

**Problem**: Similar transactions go to different categories

**Solution**: Consolidate categories or add overlapping keywords

```typescript
// Merge or add cross-references:
Category: "Food"
Description: "Restaurants, delivery (Swiggy, Zomato), groceries, snacks,
             Also see: Groceries category for bulk purchases"
```

### If New Merchants Aren't Recognized

**Problem**: AI doesn't recognize new delivery app "QuickBite"

**Solution**: Edit category description to include it

```typescript
Category: "Food & Dining"
Description: "Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats, QuickBite, restaurants, cafes"
                                        ^^^^^^^^^ Add new merchant
```

AI will immediately start recognizing it!
