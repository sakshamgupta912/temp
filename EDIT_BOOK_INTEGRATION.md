# Edit Book Screen Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated the EditBookScreen into the application with navigation from both BooksScreen and BookDetailScreen.

## Changes Made

### 1. Navigation Setup (`src/navigation/Navigation.tsx`)
- **Added Import**: Imported `EditBookScreen` component
- **Added Route Type**: Added `EditBook: { bookId: string }` to `RootStackParamList`
- **Added Stack.Screen**: Created Stack.Screen for EditBook route with Material Design styling

```typescript
<Stack.Screen 
  name="EditBook" 
  component={EditBookScreen}
  options={{ 
    title: 'Edit Book',
    headerStyle: {
      backgroundColor: theme.colors.surface,
      shadowColor: theme.colors.shadow,
      shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 2 },
      shadowOpacity: 0.1,
      shadowRadius: 4,
      elevation: 4,
    },
  }}
/>
```

### 2. BookItem Component (`src/components/BookItem.tsx`)
- **Updated Props**: Added `onEdit` callback to `BookItemProps` type
- **Updated Component**: Added `onEdit` prop to component signature
- **Updated handleEdit**: Changed from showing alert to calling `onEdit(book)` prop
- **Menu Item**: "Edit Book" menu item now functional

### 3. BooksScreen (`src/screens/BooksScreen.tsx`)
- **Added handleEditBook**: New callback that navigates to EditBook screen
  ```typescript
  const handleEditBook = useCallback((book: Book) => {
    navigation.navigate('EditBook', { bookId: book.id });
  }, [navigation]);
  ```
- **Updated BookItem Usage**: Passed `onEdit={handleEditBook}` prop to BookItem component

### 4. BookDetailScreen (`src/screens/BookDetailScreen.tsx`)
- **Added useLayoutEffect Import**: Added to React imports
- **Added Header Button**: Created edit button in header using `useLayoutEffect`
  ```typescript
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    navigation.setOptions({
      headerRight: () => (
        <IconButton
          icon="pencil"
          size={20}
          onPress={() => {
            navigation.navigate('EditBook', { bookId });
          }}
          iconColor={theme.colors.onSurface}
        />
      ),
    });
  }, [navigation, bookId, theme.colors.onSurface]);
  ```

### 5. EditBookScreen Navigation Fix
- **Fixed Delete Navigation**: Changed from `navigation.navigate('Books')` (invalid) to:
  ```typescript
  navigation.reset({
    index: 0,
    routes: [{ name: 'Main' }],
  });
  ```
  This properly resets the navigation stack to the main tab navigator after deleting a book.

## Technical Notes

### Cache Invalidation
When updating a book in EditBookScreen:
- `dataCache.invalidate('books')` - Refreshes books list
- If exchange rate changed: `dataCache.invalidate('entries')` - Refreshes all entries
- Ensures Dashboard and Analytics show updated data immediately

### Navigation Stack Management
After deleting a book:
- Uses `navigation.reset()` instead of `navigation.navigate()`
- Resets stack to Main tab navigator
- Prevents issues with back navigation to deleted book

### Exchange Rate Updates
When changing exchange rate:
- Fetches all entries for the book
- Recalculates `normalizedAmount` for each entry
- Updates all entries in database
- Invalidates cache to trigger refresh
- Dashboard/Analytics immediately show correct totals

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Undo Functionality**: Add ability to undo delete within a timeout
2. **Success Snackbar**: Replace Alert with Material Snackbar for better UX
3. **Unsaved Changes Warning**: Warn user if navigating away with unsaved changes
4. **Bulk Currency Conversion**: Option to convert all existing entries to new currency
5. **Rate History**: Show history of rate changes over time
6. **Export Before Delete**: Offer to export data before deleting book
