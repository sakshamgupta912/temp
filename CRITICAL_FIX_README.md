# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - READ THIS FIRST!

## What Was Broken

Your Git-style sync wasn't working because **local tombstones (deleted items) weren't being loaded for the merge**.

### The Bug:
```typescript
// ❌ BROKEN (Line ~1255):
const localEntries = await asyncStorageService.getEntries(book.id);
// This filters out deleted items! Merge can't see deletions!
```

### The Fix:
```typescript
// ✅ FIXED (Line ~1255):
const localEntries = await asyncStorageService.getAllEntries(user.id);
// This includes deleted items! Merge can now detect deletions!
```

---

## Quick Test (30 seconds)

1. Create entry "Test", ₹100
2. Pull-to-refresh (syncs)
3. Delete the entry
4. Pull-to-refresh immediately

**Look for this in console:**
```
📱 Local data: { 
  entries: 1,  ← Should be 1, not 0!
  deletedEntries: 1  ← Should show deleted count!
}
⬆️ Only local changed - keeping local (will push)
✅ Merge complete: 1 items (1 deleted tombstones)
```

**Expected**: Entry stays deleted ✅

---

## What Changed

### File: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (Line ~1255)

**BEFORE**:
```typescript
const localBooks = await asyncStorageService.getBooks(user.id);
const localCategories = await asyncStorageService.getCategories(user.id);
let localEntries: any[] = [];
for (const book of localBooks) {
  const bookEntries = await asyncStorageService.getEntries(book.id);
  localEntries = localEntries.concat(bookEntries);
}
```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
// CRITICAL: Use getAllX() methods to include deleted items (tombstones)
const localBooks = await asyncStorageService.getAllBooks(user.id);
const localCategories = await asyncStorageService.getAllCategories(user.id);
const localEntries = await asyncStorageService.getAllEntries(user.id);
```

## Why This Fixes Everything

### Problem Flow (Before):
```
Delete entry → Tombstone created (deleted: true)
                ↓
Pull-to-refresh → syncNow()
                ↓
Get local data → getEntries() filters deleted: true
                ↓
Merge → Sees: Local=empty, Cloud=has entry
                ↓
Decision → "Download from cloud"
                ↓
Entry comes back! 😱
```

### Fixed Flow (After):
```
Delete entry → Tombstone created (deleted: true, version++)
                ↓
Pull-to-refresh → syncNow()
                ↓
Get local data → getAllEntries() includes deleted: true
                ↓
Merge → Sees: Local=v2 deleted, Cloud=v1 not deleted
                ↓
Decision → "Local changed, keep deletion"
                ↓
Upload tombstone to cloud
                ↓
Entry stays deleted! ✅
```

## All 4 Fixes Together

This is the **4th and final fix**. All together:

1. ✅ **Version increment on delete** (`asyncStorage.ts`)
2. ✅ **Merge logic fixed** (`gitStyleSync.ts`)  
3. ✅ **Keep tombstones in merge** (`gitStyleSync.ts`)
4. ✅ **Load tombstones for merge** (`AuthContext.tsx`) ← **THIS FIX**

## Console Log Checklist

After deleting an entry, you should see:

- ✅ `deletedEntries: 1` (not 0)
- ✅ `Only local changed - keeping local`
- ✅ `Merge complete: X items (1 deleted tombstones)`
- ✅ Entry not visible in list

If you see all ✅ → **Sync is working!**
