## 📋 Quick Test (2 Minutes)

### Prerequisites
- 2 devices (or 1 device + Firebase Console)
- Same Google account on both
- Internet connection

### The Critical Test
**This was failing before - let's verify it works now!**

1. **Device A:**
   - Create a book "Test Book 1"
   - Wait 2 seconds (auto-sync)

2. **Device B:**
   - Pull down to refresh on Books screen
   - ✅ See "Test Book 1" appear

3. **Device A:**
   - Delete "Test Book 1"
   - Wait 2 seconds (auto-sync)

4. **Device B:**
   - Pull down to refresh
   - ✅ "Test Book 1" should be GONE

**Pass?** ✅ Multi-device sync is working!
**Fail?** ❌ Check console logs, see troubleshooting

## 🎯 Key Changes

### Before (Broken)
- Timestamp comparison
- Overwrites entire datasets
- Data loss on deletions

### After (Working)
- Cloud-first merge
- Understands what exists

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Data not syncing
**Check:** Same Google account? Internet on?
**Solution:** Pull down to refresh (manual sync)

**Problem:** "Sync already in progress"
**Solution:** Wait 2 seconds, try again

**Problem:** Console errors
**Solution:** Copy logs, check `CLOUD_FIRST_SYNC_TEST.md` troubleshooting section
