- Demo user sign-in (shows info message)

## 📂 **File Status:**
- ✅ `firebase.ts` - Updated with your real config
- ✅ `AuthContext.tsx` - Simplified version (working)
- 🔄 `googleAuthService.expo.ts` - Expo version ready (not connected yet)
- 🔄 `firebaseSyncService.expo.ts` - Expo version ready (not connected yet)
- 📁 Old files moved to `.old.ts` (backup)

## 🎯 **Next Steps to Complete Firebase Integration:**

### **1. Enable Firebase Services in Console**
Go to **https://console.firebase.google.com/project/cocona-472b7**:

**Enable Authentication:**
```
Authentication → Get Started → Sign-in method → Google → Enable
```

**Enable Firestore:**
```
Firestore Database → Create database → Start in test mode
```

### **2. Connect Expo Services**
Once Firebase Console is configured:
1. Update `AuthContext.tsx` to use `googleAuthService.expo.ts`
2. Test Google Sign-In
3. Enable sync services

### **3. Test Firebase Connection**
You can test your Firebase connection by temporarily adding this to `App.tsx`:
```tsx
import FirebaseQuickTest from './FirebaseQuickTest';
// Replace main component temporarily
```

## 🚀 **Ready for Next Phase!**

Your app is now stable and ready for Firebase integration. The core functionality works, and Firebase services are configured but not yet connected.
