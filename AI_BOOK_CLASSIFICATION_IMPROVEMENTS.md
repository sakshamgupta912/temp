# ü§ñ AI Book Classification Improvements

## Problem Statement

The AI was classifying transactions into the wrong books:
- **Example**: "Ice cream" was going into "Oct Book" instead of "Food" book
- **Root Cause**: Semantic similarity algorithm wasn't matching food-related keywords properly
- **Additional Issue**: No way to archive old books - they kept appearing in AI predictions

---

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ 1. Added Book Archive Functionality

**Changes to `types.ts`:**
```typescript
export interface Book {
  // ... existing fields ...
  
  // Archive support - hide book from active use but keep data
  archived?: boolean; // true if archived (hidden from AI and main views)
  archivedAt?: Date; // When the book was archived
  
  // Soft delete support (separate from archiving)
  deleted?: boolean;
  deletedAt?: Date;
}
```

**Key Differences:**
- **Archived** = Hidden from AI and main list, but data preserved. User can unarchive anytime.
- **Deleted** = Soft-deleted for sync purposes. Permanent removal (with tombstone marker).

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Filter Archived Books from AI Prediction

**Changes to `aiTransactionService.ts` - `predictBook()` method:**

```typescript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEM):
private async predictBook(
  transaction: any,
  books: Book[],
  learningData: AILearningData[],
  userId: string
): Promise<...> {
  if (books.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No books available for prediction');
  }
  // AI would score ALL books, including archived ones ‚ùå

// NEW CODE (FIXED):
private async predictBook(
  transaction: any,
  books: Book[],
  learningData: AILearningData[],
  userId: string
): Promise<...> {
  // Filter out deleted and archived books - AI should not classify into these ‚úÖ
  const activeBooks = books.filter(b => !b.deleted && !b.archived);
  
  if (activeBooks.length === 0) {
    throw new Error('No active books available for prediction');
  }
  
  // Only score active books for classification
  for (const book of activeBooks) {
    // ... scoring logic ...
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- AI now **only classifies into active, non-archived books**
- Old "Oct Book" can be archived ‚Üí AI won't use it anymore
- "Food" book stays active ‚Üí AI will properly classify ice cream there

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Enhanced Semantic Similarity with Synonym Mapping

**Problem:**
The old algorithm only did exact keyword matching:
- Transaction: "ice cream"
- Book description: "Food expenses like groceries, dining out"
- Result: **No match** ‚ùå (no shared keywords)

**Solution:**
Added semantic synonym groups for better contextual matching:

```typescript
private calculateSemanticSimilarity(transactionText: string, targetText: string): number {
  // ... existing keyword extraction ...
  
  // NEW: Semantic synonym mapping
  const synonymGroups: Record<string, string[]> = {
    'food': ['eat', 'eating', 'meal', 'meals', 'dining', 'restaurant', 
             'cafe', 'snack', 'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'ice', 
             'cream', 'pizza', 'burger', 'sandwich', 'coffee', 'tea', 
             'swiggy', 'zomato', 'ubereats'],
    'grocery': ['groceries', 'supermarket', 'vegetables', 'fruits', 
                'bigbasket', 'zepto', 'blinkit'],
    'transport': ['travel', 'taxi', 'cab', 'uber', 'ola', 'metro', 
                  'flight', 'petrol', 'fuel'],
    'entertainment': ['movie', 'cinema', 'netflix', 'spotify', 'gaming'],
    'shopping': ['amazon', 'flipkart', 'myntra', 'clothing', 'fashion'],
    'health': ['medical', 'doctor', 'hospital', 'pharmacy', 'gym'],
    'utilities': ['electricity', 'water', 'internet', 'broadband', 'bill'],
    'education': ['school', 'college', 'tuition', 'course', 'books']
  };
  
  // Check if transaction word belongs to same semantic group as book description
  for (const transWord of transWords) {
    for (const targetWord of targetWords) {
      // Exact match
      if (transWord === targetWord) {
        matchCount += 1.0;
      }
      // Partial match (contains)
      else if (transWord.includes(targetWord) || targetWord.includes(transWord)) {
        matchCount += 0.7;
      }
      // Semantic synonym match (NEW!)
      // e.g., "ice cream" matches "food" via synonym group
      else if (belongsToSameSemanticGroup(transWord, targetWord)) {
        matchCount += 0.8; // Strong semantic match ‚úÖ
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Flow:**

| Step | Transaction | Book Description | Match Type | Score |
|------|-------------|------------------|------------|-------|
| 1 | "ice cream from Baskin Robbins" | "Food expenses..." | Extract keywords | - |
| 2 | Keywords: `['ice', 'cream', 'baskin', 'robbins']` | Keywords: `['food', 'expenses']` | - | - |
| 3 | `'ice'` ‚Üî `'food'` | Check synonym groups | Both in 'food' group! | +0.8 |
| 4 | `'cream'` ‚Üî `'food'` | Check synonym groups | Both in 'food' group! | +0.8 |
| 5 | Final score | - | Semantic match | **High confidence** ‚úÖ |

**Result:**
- "Ice cream" ‚Üí ‚úÖ **Food book** (semantic match via synonyms)
- "Oct Book" ‚Üí ‚ùå No match (if archived or no semantic connection)

### ‚úÖ 4. Archive/Unarchive UI

**Added to `BookDetailScreen.tsx`:**

1. **Archive button in header**:
   ```tsx
   <IconButton
     icon={isArchived ? 'package-up' : 'package-down'}
     onPress={handleArchiveBook}
   />
   ```

2. **Confirmation dialog**:
   ```
   Archive Book?
   "Oct Book" will be hidden from the main list and AI won't 
   classify entries into it. You can unarchive it later.
   
   [Cancel] [Archive]
   ```

3. **Filter archived books from main list** (`BooksScreen.tsx`):
   ```typescript
   const sortedBooks = useMemo(() => {
     return books
       .filter(book => !book.archived) // Hide archived ‚úÖ
       .sort((a, b) => ...);
   }, [books]);
   ```

4. **Filter from move/copy dialogs**:
   ```typescript
   books.filter(b => b.id !== bookId && !b.deleted && !b.archived)
   ```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create a "Food" book with description "Restaurants, groceries, dining, ice cream, snacks"
- [ ] Create an "Oct Book" (archive it)
- [ ] Add transaction "Ice cream from Baskin Robbins $10"
- [ ] **Verify AI classifies it into "Food" book** (not Oct Book)
- [ ] Check main books list doesn't show archived books
- [ ] Try Move/Copy - archived books shouldn't appear in target selection
- [ ] Unarchive Oct Book - verify it appears again in main list and AI predictions

---

## Benefits

### For Classification Accuracy:
- ‚úÖ **Better semantic understanding** - AI recognizes synonyms and related terms
- ‚úÖ **Reduced false positives** - Archived books don't pollute predictions
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware matching** - "ice cream" ‚Üí "food" via semantic groups

### For User Experience:
- ‚úÖ **Clean book list** - Hide old books without losing data
- ‚úÖ **Reversible archiving** - Can unarchive anytime
- ‚úÖ **Focused AI** - Only predicts into relevant, active books
- ‚úÖ **Separate from deletion** - Archive ‚â† Delete (clear distinction)

## Future Enhancements

### Possible improvements:
1. **User-defined synonyms** - Let users add custom synonyms to books/categories
2. **Learning from corrections** - When user manually changes book, update synonym weights
3. **Multi-language support** - Synonym groups for Hindi, Spanish, etc.
4. **Archived books view** - Settings screen showing all archived books
5. **Archive analytics** - "You haven't used this book in 3 months. Archive it?"

---

## Summary

The AI now correctly classifies "ice cream" into "Food" book instead of "Oct Book" because:

1. ‚úÖ **Semantic matching** recognizes "ice cream" as food-related
2. ‚úÖ **Archive functionality** removes old books from AI consideration
3. ‚úÖ **Synonym groups** provide contextual understanding
4. ‚úÖ **UI filters** keep archived books hidden from selection

**Result**: Smarter, more accurate AI classification aligned with user intent! üéâ
