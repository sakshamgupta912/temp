# Android Emulator Setup Guide for Multi-Device Testing

## Why Use an Emulator?

You already have 2 physical phones for testing. An emulator gives you a 3rd device to test:
- **3-way sync**: Device A, Device B, and Emulator all syncing together
- **Faster testing**: No need to switch between phones
- **Debug tools**: Better logging and inspection

## Option 1: Android Studio Emulator (Full-Featured)

### Installation Steps

1. **Download Android Studio**
   - Visit: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Download for Windows (1.1 GB installer)
   - Install to default location

2. **Open Android Studio**
   - First launch will download additional components (~2-3 GB)
   - Wait for initialization to complete

3. **Create Virtual Device**
   ```
   Tools → Device Manager → Create Device
   
   Choose a Device:
   - Select "Pixel 5" or "Pixel 6" (recommended)
   - Click "Next"
   
   System Image:
   - Select "Tiramisu" (Android 13) or "UpsideDownCake" (Android 14)
   - Click "Download" if not installed
   - Click "Next"
   
   Verify Configuration:
   - Name: "Pixel_5_API_33"
   - Click "Finish"
   ```

4. **Launch Emulator**
   ```
   Device Manager → Click ▶️ Play button next to your device
   Wait 30-60 seconds for boot
   ```

5. **Install Expo Go on Emulator**
   ```
   Option A: From Play Store
   - Open Play Store in emulator
   - Search "Expo Go"
   - Install
   
   Option B: From Command Line
   - Run in your terminal:
     npx expo start
   - Press 'a' to open on Android emulator
   - Expo Go will auto-install
   ```

6. **Connect to Your App**
   ```
   In your terminal (where Expo is running):
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go in emulator
   OR
   - Press 'a' to automatically open
   ```

### Emulator Requirements
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum (16GB recommended)
- **Disk Space**: 10GB free space
- **CPU**: Intel/AMD with virtualization enabled
  - Enable in BIOS: Intel VT-x or AMD-V

---

## Option 2: BlueStacks (Lighter Alternative)

If Android Studio is too heavy:

1. **Download BlueStacks**
   - Visit: https://www.bluestacks.com/
   - Download BlueStacks 5 (lighter than Android Studio)
   - Install and launch

2. **Install Expo Go**
   - Open Play Store in BlueStacks
   - Search "Expo Go"
   - Install

3. **Connect**
   - Scan QR code from Expo terminal
   - Your app will load

### BlueStacks Requirements
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum
- **Disk Space**: 5GB free space
- **Lighter**: Faster startup than Android Studio

---

## Option 3: Use Expo Web (Quick Testing)

For quick testing without emulator:

```bash
# In your project terminal
npx expo start --web
```

- Opens app in Chrome browser
- Limited React Native features
- Good for UI testing, not full device simulation

## Testing Multi-Device Sync with Emulator

### Scenario: 3 Devices Syncing

**Device A (Phone 1)** → Create Book "Travel"
**Device B (Phone 2)** → Should see "Travel" appear
**Emulator** → Should also see "Travel" appear

### Test Steps:

1. **Sign in on all 3 devices**
   - Use same email/password
   - Enable Cloud Sync on all

2. **Test Real-Time Sync**
   ```
   Phone 1: Create entry "Coffee - $5"
   Wait 2-3 seconds...
   Phone 2: Check → Should show "Coffee - $5"
   Emulator: Check → Should show "Coffee - $5"
   ```

3. **Test Conflict Resolution**
   ```
   Phone 1: Edit Book X → Name = "Version A"
   Phone 2: Edit Book X → Name = "Version B" (5 seconds later)
   Result: All devices show "Version B" (newer timestamp wins)
   ```

4. **Test Deletion**
   ```
   Emulator: Delete entry "Lunch"
   Phone 1: Should see "Lunch" disappear
   Phone 2: Should see "Lunch" disappear
   ```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Emulator Won't Start
**Problem**: "Emulator: ERROR: x86 emulation currently requires hardware acceleration!"
**Solution**:
1. Open BIOS (restart, press F2/Del during boot)
2. Enable "Intel VT-x" or "AMD-V" (virtualization)
3. Save and restart

### Emulator Too Slow
**Solutions**:
- Close other programs
- Allocate more RAM:
  ```
  Device Manager → Edit device → Show Advanced Settings
  RAM: Set to 4096 MB (if you have 16GB total RAM)
  ```
- Use "Cold Boot" instead of snapshot

### Can't Connect to Expo
**Problem**: Emulator can't reach Expo server
**Solution**:
```bash
# Use tunnel mode
npx expo start --tunnel

# Then scan QR in emulator's Expo Go
```

### Firebase Permissions Error
**Problem**: "Missing or insufficient permissions"
**Solution**:
- Check Firebase console → Firestore → Rules
- Ensure rules allow authenticated users:
  ```
  rules_version = '2';
  service cloud.firestore {
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
      match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Performance Comparison

| Method | Startup Time | RAM Usage | Best For |
|--------|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Android Studio Emulator | 60-90s | 2-4 GB | Full testing, debugging |
| BlueStacks | 30-45s | 1-2 GB | Quick testing |
| Physical Device | Instant | 0 | Real-world testing |
| Expo Web | 5-10s | 500 MB | UI-only testing |

## My Recommendation

**For your use case (multi-device sync testing):**

**Best Setup**: Keep using your 2 physical phones! They're perfect for testing real-world sync scenarios.

**Add Emulator If**:
- You want to test 3+ devices simultaneously
- You need better debug tools
- You want to test different Android versions

**Don't Need Emulator If**:
- You're happy with 2-device testing
- Your laptop has limited RAM (<8GB)
- You want faster testing (physical devices are faster)

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check if emulator exists
emulator -list-avds

# Start specific emulator
emulator -avd Pixel_5_API_33

# Launch Expo on emulator
npx expo start
# Then press 'a'

# Use tunnel (if connection fails)
npx expo start --tunnel

# Kill all emulators
adb -s emulator-5554 emu kill
```

---

**Bottom Line**: Your 2 phones are already perfect for testing multi-device sync! Only install an emulator if you need a 3rd device or want advanced debugging tools.
