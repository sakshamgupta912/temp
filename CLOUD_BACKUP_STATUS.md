# ☁️ Cloud Backup Status - What's Being Synced

## ✅ YES - Everything is Backed Up to Firebase!

Your app has **comprehensive cloud backup** enabled. Here's what's being synced:

---

## 📊 Data Being Synced

### 1. ✅ **Books**
- All your books (Personal, Business, etc.)
- Book settings (currency, locked exchange rates, target currency)
- Book metadata (creation date, update date, etc.)

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 620: AuthContext.tsx
const books = await asyncStorageService.getAllBooks(userId);
await setDoc(userDocRef, {
  books: sanitizedBooks,
  // ...
});
```

### 2. ✅ **Categories**
- All your categories (Food, Transport, Entertainment, etc.)
- Category descriptions (used by AI for semantic matching!)
- Custom user categories
- Default categories

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 621: AuthContext.tsx
const categories = await asyncStorageService.getAllCategories(userId);
await setDoc(userDocRef, {
  categories: sanitizedCategories,
  // ...
});
```

### 3. ✅ **Entries (Including AI Entries!)**
- All manual entries
- All AI-imported entries
- Entry amounts, dates, categories
- Party/customer names
- Payment modes
- Remarks
- Normalized amounts for multi-currency
- Historical exchange rates

**Code Evidence:**
```typescript
// Line 622: AuthContext.tsx
const allEntries = await asyncStorageService.getAllEntries(userId);
await setDoc(userDocRef, {
  entries: sanitizedEntries,
  // ...
});
```

## 🤖 AI Data Being Synced

### ✅ **AI Pending Transactions** (Stored Locally Only - By Design)
**Status:** Not synced to Firebase (intentional)

**Why?**
- Pending transactions are temporary (need your approval)
- Once approved/rejected, they become entries (which ARE synced)
- No need to sync temporary data across devices

**What happens:**
```
1. AI creates pending transaction → Stored locally
2. You approve → Creates Entry → Entry synced to Firebase ✅
3. You reject → Deleted locally → No cloud storage needed
```

### ✅ **AI Learning Data** (Stored Locally Only)
**Status:** Not synced to Firebase (currently)

**Data includes:**
- Merchant patterns (e.g., "Swiggy" → "Food" category)
- User corrections
- Prediction accuracy scores

**Why not synced?**
- Device-specific learning
- Privacy-focused (your usage patterns stay on device)
- Can be regenerated from synced entries

**Note:** If you want AI learning data synced, we can add it!

## 📱 How Sync Works

### Git-Style Sync (PULL → MERGE → PUSH)

Your app uses a sophisticated **Git-style sync** similar to how Git works:

```
1. PULL (Download from Cloud)
   ↓
2. MERGE (Three-way merge: base, local, cloud)
   ↓
3. PUSH (Upload merged result to Cloud)
```

**Code Location:** `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` (Lines 681-700)

### Sync Triggers

**Automatic Sync:**
- ✅ When you sign in
- ✅ When you pull-to-refresh on any screen
- ✅ Every 5 minutes (if auto-sync enabled)
- ✅ When app comes to foreground

**Manual Sync:**
- Pull down on any screen (shows "Syncing..." banner)
- Sign out and sign back in

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Sync

**Status:** ✅ Enabled

Your app uses **Firestore Real-Time Listeners** for instant sync:

```typescript
// When data changes in cloud:
onSnapshot(userDocRef, async (snapshot) => {
  // Downloads changes automatically
  // Merges with local data
  // Updates UI immediately
});
```

**What this means:**
- Changes on Device A appear on Device B **within seconds**
- No need to manually refresh
- Works even if app is in background

---

## 🛡️ Data Safety Features

### 1. **Conflict Resolution**
If you edit on multiple devices simultaneously:
```
Device A: Changes category "Food" → "Food & Dining"
Device B: Changes same category "Food" → "Meals"

Result: App detects conflict, keeps both versions
You decide: Use Device A's version OR Device B's version
```

### 2. **Deletion Sync**
```
Device A: Deletes entry
Cloud: Marks as deleted (tombstone)
Device B: Removes entry (synced deletion ✅)
```

### 3. **Offline Support**
```
No Internet → All changes saved locally
Internet returns → Auto-syncs when online
No data loss!
```

## 🔍 Verify Your Backup

### Check Firebase Console

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: **cocona-472b7**
3. Click **Firestore Database**
4. Navigate to: `users → [your-user-id]`

You should see:
```
users/
  └── [your-user-id]/
      ├── books: [array of books]
      ├── entries: [array of entries]
      ├── categories: [array of categories]
      └── lastSyncAt: [timestamp]
```

### Check Sync Status in App

**Pull down on any screen:**
```
✅ "Synced just now"
✅ "Last synced 2 minutes ago"
⚠️ "Sync failed - check connection"
```

## 🚀 Multi-Device Experience

### Scenario: You have 2 devices

**Device A (Phone):**
```
1. Add AI transaction: "Swiggy ₹350"
2. AI predicts: Food & Dining
3. Approve transaction
4. Entry created → Syncs to cloud ☁️
```

**Device B (Tablet):**
```
5. Pull to refresh
6. Downloads entry from cloud ☁️
7. Entry appears: "Food & Dining - Swiggy ₹350" ✅
```

**Both devices show identical data!**

## 🔧 Want More?

### Optional: Sync AI Learning Data

If you want AI learning data synced across devices:

**Benefits:**
- AI learns from corrections on Device A
- Device B gets smarter predictions immediately
- Unified AI experience across all devices

**Trade-offs:**
- Slightly more data in cloud
- Privacy consideration (usage patterns in cloud)
