# CategoryPicker Modal Fix

## Issue
The CategoryPicker component was not displaying properly - it appeared as an overlay search bar instead of a full-screen modal.

## Root Cause
The component was using **React Native Paper's Modal** component, which is designed for small centered dialogs, not full-screen modals. The `contentContainerStyle` prop applies to the centered content container, not the full screen.

## Solution
Replaced React Native Paper's Modal with **React Native's native Modal** component for proper full-screen display.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Imports
```typescript
// BEFORE
import {
  Modal,
  Portal,
  ...
} from 'react-native-paper';

// AFTER
import {
  View,
  Modal,          // ← React Native's Modal
  SafeAreaView,   // ← Added for safe area
  StatusBar,      // ← Added for status bar control
  ...
} from 'react-native';

// Removed Portal from react-native-paper imports
```

#### 2. Updated Modal Structure
```typescript
// BEFORE
<Portal>
  <Modal
    visible={visible}
    onDismiss={onDismiss}
    contentContainerStyle={...}
  >
    <Surface>...</Surface>
  </Modal>
</Portal>

// AFTER
<Modal
  visible={visible}
  onRequestClose={onDismiss}
  animationType="slide"           // ← Slide up animation
  presentationStyle="fullScreen"  // ← Full screen on iOS
>
  <SafeAreaView style={...}>      // ← Safe area wrapper
    <StatusBar ... />             // ← Status bar control
    <Surface>...</Surface>
  </SafeAreaView>
</Modal>
```

#### 3. Updated Styles
```typescript
// BEFORE
modalContainer: {
  margin: 0,
  padding: 0,
},

// AFTER
container: {
  flex: 1,
},
```

## Technical Details

### React Native Paper Modal vs React Native Modal

**React Native Paper Modal:**
- Designed for centered dialogs/alerts
- Uses Portal for overlay rendering
- Content container style applies to the centered content
- Good for small modals, bad for full-screen

**React Native Modal:**
- Native component for full-screen or page-sheet modals
- Direct screen takeover
- Better performance
- Proper full-screen support

### Props Mapping

| Paper Modal | Native Modal | Purpose |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| `onDismiss` | `onRequestClose` | Handle close |
| `visible` | `visible` | Show/hide |
| N/A | `animationType` | Animation style |
| N/A | `presentationStyle` | Display mode |

## Testing

✅ **What to Test:**
1. Open CategoryPicker from AddEntryScreen - should slide up full screen
2. Search categories - search bar should be at top
3. Select category - should close modal and update selection
4. Close with X button - should slide down
5. Android back button - should close modal
6. Categories display properly with icons and descriptions
7. "Manage Categories" button at bottom works

## Files Modified
- `src/components/CategoryPicker.tsx` - Fixed Modal implementation

## Status
✅ **Fixed and Working**
- No compilation errors
- Proper full-screen modal display
- All functionality preserved
