## User Flow Example

### Scenario: Concurrent Edit Conflict

1. **User opens DashboardScreen**
   - Banner shows: "‚úÖ Up to date ‚Ä¢ Last synced 2 mins ago"

2. **User edits book on Phone 1: "Travel 2024"**
   - Banner briefly shows: "üîÑ Syncing..."
   - Then: "‚úÖ Up to date ‚Ä¢ Last synced Just now"

3. **Meanwhile, Phone 2 edits same book: "Vacation Budget"**
   - Phone 2 syncs first
   - Phone 1 tries to sync ‚Üí **Conflict detected!**

4. **Phone 1 banner changes:**
   - Banner shows: "‚ö†Ô∏è 1 conflict needs resolution" with "Resolve" button
   - Banner is tappable/clickable

5. **User taps banner:**
   - `ConflictResolutionModal` opens
   - Shows side-by-side comparison:
     - Your Change: "Travel 2024"
     - Their Change: "Vacation Budget"

6. **User chooses resolution:**
   - Taps "Keep Mine" ‚Üí "Travel 2024" wins
   - Modal closes
   - Banner shows: "üîÑ Syncing..."
   - Then: "‚úÖ Up to date ‚Ä¢ Last synced Just now"

## Code Structure

### Banner Component
```tsx
<SyncStatusBanner />
```

- **Self-contained** - No props needed
- **Auto-updates** - Polls sync status every 5 seconds
- **Context-aware** - Uses `useAuth()` to get sync status
- **Modal integration** - Opens conflict modal when conflicts exist

### Placement Pattern

```tsx
return (
  <View style={styles.container}>
    <SyncStatusBanner />  {/* Always at top */}
    
    {/* Rest of screen content */}
    <ScrollView>
      {/* ... */}
    </ScrollView>
  </View>
);
```

## What Users Get

### Visibility
- **Always visible** at top of main screens
- **Persistent** across navigation within main tabs
- **Clear status** at a glance

### Interactivity
- **Tap to resolve** conflicts
- **Tap to retry** on errors
- **No interaction** when syncing or up to date

### Peace of Mind
- **No silent failures** - Errors are visible
- **No data loss** - Conflicts require resolution
- **Clear feedback** - Users know sync state

## Testing

To test the integration:

1. **Open app on two devices**
2. **Navigate to Dashboard/Books/Analytics/Settings**
3. **Verify banner appears at top**
4. **Make concurrent edits** on same field
5. **Watch banner change** to show conflicts
6. **Tap "Resolve"** button
7. **Verify modal opens** with conflict details

## Technical Details

### Auto-Updates
- Polls `getSyncStatus()` every 5 seconds
- Updates when `conflictCount` changes
- Shows real-time sync state

### Animations
- **Pulse animation** during sync (opacity 1.0 ‚Üî 0.5)
- **Rotating icon** during sync (handled by component)
- **Smooth transitions** between states

### Integration Points
- Uses `useAuth()` hook for sync status
- Opens `ConflictResolutionModal` on conflict tap
- Calls `syncNow()` on error retry

## Benefits

1. **User Awareness**
   - Users always know sync state
   - No confusion about data freshness

2. **Quick Action**
   - One tap to resolve conflicts
   - One tap to retry errors

3. **Non-Intrusive**

   - Doesn't block content
   - Auto-hides when sync disabled

4. **Consistent Experience**
   - Same banner on all main screens
   - Predictable behavior
   - Familiar UI pattern
