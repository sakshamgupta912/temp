# Default Category Selection - "Others"

## Overview
Updated AddEntryScreen to automatically select "Others" as the default category when creating a new entry.

## Changes Made

### AddEntryScreen.tsx ✅

**Added Default Category Selection:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (user) {
    // Categories are loaded by CategoryPicker component
    initializeCurrency();
    // Set "Others" as default category
    setSelectedCategory('Others');
  }
}, [user]);
```

**What This Does:**
- When the AddEntryScreen component loads
- After user authentication is confirmed
- Automatically sets `selectedCategory` to "Others"
- User sees "Others" pre-selected in the category button

### EditEntryScreen.tsx ✅
**No Changes Needed** - EditEntryScreen loads the existing entry's category from the database, so it should not default to "Others".

## User Experience

### Before ❌
1. User opens "Add Entry" screen
2. Category shows: "Select Category" (empty)
3. User must click and select a category
4. Extra step required

### After ✅
1. User opens "Add Entry" screen
2. Category shows: "Others" (pre-selected)
3. User can immediately save if "Others" is appropriate
4. Or click to change to a different category
5. Faster entry creation!

## Benefits

### 1. **Faster Data Entry**
- One less tap for most entries
- "Others" is the most general category
- Reduces friction in entry creation

### 2. **Always Valid**
- Category field is never empty by default
- Reduces validation errors
- Better user experience

### 3. **Smart Default**
- "Others" is the catch-all category
- Most logical default choice
- User can easily change if needed

### 4. **Consistent with Design**
- "Others" is mandatory and always available
- Makes sense as the default fallback
- Aligns with category hierarchy

## Technical Details

### Timing
- Default is set when component mounts
- Happens after user authentication
- Before user interacts with form
- Synchronous - no loading delay

### State Flow
```
Component Mount
    ↓
User Authenticated
    ↓
useEffect Triggered
    ↓
setSelectedCategory('Others')
    ↓
UI Updates - Button shows "Others"
    ↓
User can proceed or change
```

### Validation
- Category validation still works normally
- "Others" counts as a valid selection
- User can still change to any other category
- No required field error on load

## Edge Cases Handled

✅ **User Not Logged In:**
- useEffect only runs if `user` exists
- Won't set category until authenticated

✅ **"Others" Doesn't Exist:**
- "Others" is auto-created by getCategories()
- Guaranteed to always exist
- Selection will always be valid

✅ **User Changes Category:**
- Works normally
- Previous selection replaced
- No conflicts

✅ **User Clears Selection:**
- Can still select "Select Category"
- Validation will catch it on save
- Expected behavior preserved

## Testing Checklist

✅ **Add Entry Screen:**
- [ ] Open "Add Entry" screen
- [ ] Category button shows "Others" (not "Select Category")
- [ ] Click category button - CategoryPicker opens
- [ ] "Others" is highlighted as selected
- [ ] Can change to different category
- [ ] Can save entry with "Others" selected

✅ **Edit Entry Screen:**
- [ ] Open existing entry
- [ ] Category shows the entry's actual category (not "Others")
- [ ] Can change category normally
- [ ] Saves correctly

✅ **Validation:**
- [ ] With "Others" selected - no category validation error
- [ ] Change to another category - still valid
- [ ] Form can be submitted successfully

## Code Location

**File:** `src/screens/AddEntryScreen.tsx`
**Line:** ~73-75
**Function:** `useEffect` hook for user initialization

## Related Features

- **"Others" Mandatory Category** - Ensures "Others" always exists
- **CategoryPicker Component** - Shows "Others" in category list
- **Auto-Creation** - getCategories() creates "Others" if missing

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

Could add user preferences to:
- Remember last used category
- Set custom default category
- Different defaults per entry type (income/expense)

## Summary

**What:** Auto-select "Others" as default category in AddEntryScreen
**Why:** Faster entry creation, better UX, always valid
**How:** Set selectedCategory in useEffect on mount
**Impact:** One less tap per entry, smoother workflow
