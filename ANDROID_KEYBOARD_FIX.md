```powershell
npx eas-cli login
```
Enter your Expo credentials (or create account at https://expo.dev)

Already done! ‚úÖ (eas.json created)

#### Step 3: Build Development APK
**Option A: Build in Cloud (Easier)**
```powershell
eas build --profile development --platform android
```
- Takes 10-20 minutes

- Install APK on your phone

**Option B: Build Locally (Faster but needs setup)**
```powershell
eas build --profile development --platform android --local
```
- Requires Android SDK installed
- Builds on your computer
- Generates APK immediately

#### Step 4: Install & Use
1. Download the APK to your phone
2. Install it (allow "Install from unknown sources")
3. Open the new "Cocona (dev)" app
4. Run `npm start` on computer
5. Scan QR code or press 'a'

**Advantages:**
- ‚úÖ No Expo Go limitations

## Build Commands Reference

### Development Build (APK)
```powershell
# Cloud build (recommended for first time)
eas build --profile development --platform android

# Local build (faster, needs Android SDK)
eas build --profile development --platform android --local
```

### Check Build Status
```powershell
eas build:list
```

### Run with Development Build
```powershell
npm start
# The dev build app will connect automatically
# Or scan QR code with the development app
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "An Expo user account is required"
```powershell
eas login
# Enter your expo.dev credentials
```

### "Android SDK not found" (for local builds)
Install Android Studio with SDK tools

### "Build failed"
Check logs:
```powershell
eas build:list
# Click on the build to see detailed logs
```

## Why This Happens

- **Expo Go** is a generic app trying to support all React Native features
- **Newer Android versions** (13+) have stricter touch/input handling
- **Expo Go** hasn't been optimized for latest Android changes
- **Development Build** creates a custom app specific to your project
- **Development Build** = Better compatibility + Better performance
